# ProximityScanner

**Version:** 2.3.0
**Author:** Skillu 
**Game:** Rust (uMod / Oxide)
**Type:** Server plugin (command-only)

---

## Overview

ProximityScanner adds a single chat command that tells players whether any other players are within a configurable radius.  
It does not reveal identities, positions, or exact counts‚Äîjust a simple ‚Äúdetected / clear‚Äù result that‚Äôs fair and privacy-friendly.

- Works out of the box for everyone (no permissions required by default).
- Optional permission tiers let you give VIPs different radius/cooldown.
- Flexible filters (ignore teammates/admins/safezone/sleepers/dead/NPCs).
- Admin logging (file + console) and an admin test command.
- **Localization via uMod Lang API** with optional message overrides in config.

---

## Features

- `/scan` returns a boolean presence check within a radius.
- Configurable radius and cooldown (defaults: 100 m, 10 minutes).
- Per-player cooldown; optional tier overrides per permission.
- Filters:
  - `IgnoreTeammates`
  - `IgnoreAdmins`
  - `IgnoreSafezone`
  - `IgnoreSleeping`
  - `IgnoreDead`
  - `IgnoreNPC`
- Logs each scan (anonymized) to `oxide/logs/ProximityScanner*.txt`.
- Admin test command: simulate scanning from another player‚Äôs position.
- Messages are served via **Lang API** (English by default).

---

## Quick Start

1. Place `ProximityScanner.cs` in `oxide/plugins/`.
2. Restart the server or run:
```
oxide.reload ProximityScanner
```
3. Players can use `/scan` immediately.

> By default, no extra permissions are needed. If you want to gate usage, set `RequireUsePermission` to `true` in the config and grant `proximityscanner.use`.

---

## Commands

### Player
```
/scan
```
Replies with:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Players detected nearby!` or
- `‚úÖ Area is clear.`

Also informs about cooldown start and time remaining if it‚Äôs used early, and notifies when cooldown ends.

### Admin
```
/scan.for <steamIdOrName>
```
Simulates a scan from the target player‚Äôs position using the caller‚Äôs tier settings.  
Does not consume cooldown and does not affect the target. Useful for verification and testing.

## Permissions (optional)

| Permission                | Purpose                                                             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `proximityscanner.use`    | Only needed if `RequireUsePermission: true`.                        |
| `proximityscanner.admin`  | Allows `/scan.for` and future admin tools.                          |
| `proximityscanner.tier1`  | Example tier: override radius/cooldown. Priority decides the winner.|
| `proximityscanner.tier2`  | Example tier with higher priority.                                  |
| `proximityscanner.tier3`  | Example tier with highest priority.                                 |

Grant examples:
```
oxide.grant group vip proximityscanner.tier2
oxide.grant user <steamId> proximityscanner.admin
```

## Localization

All player/admin messages are provided through the **uMod Lang API** (English by default).  
You can also set message overrides in the plugin config under `Msg`. On load, the plugin registers those overrides into the English locale so you can customize text without editing the code. Translations for other languages can be added by placing language files in `oxide/lang/` as usual.

---

## Configuration

File: `oxide/config/ProximityScanner.json` (generated on first run)

### Keys

- `RequireUsePermission` ‚Äî set to `true` to restrict `/scan` to users with `proximityscanner.use`.
- `DefaultScanRadius` ‚Äî meters.
- `DefaultCooldownSeconds` ‚Äî seconds.
- `Filter` ‚Äî booleans for common exclusions.
- `Log` ‚Äî enable/disable logging and tweak details.
- `Msg` ‚Äî message text overrides; pushed into Lang on load (English locale).
- `PermissionTiers` ‚Äî optional override sets keyed by permissions. Highest `Priority` among a player‚Äôs granted tiers wins (overrides both radius and cooldown).

    }
  ]
}
```

## Logging

- File path: `oxide/logs/ProximityScanner*.txt`
- Each line includes: mode (user/test), actor name, SteamID, radius, result, cooldown, and optionally position and match count.
- Example:
```
mode=user | actor="Alice" | steamid=76561198... | radius=150 | result=detected | cooldown=360s | pos=(123.4,45.6,789.0)
```
Logs never include identities of detected players.

## Notes & Compatibility

- The plugin provides a boolean proximity check only. No names, no positions, no distances for players.
- Intended for fair-play servers; configurable filters avoid noisy or unfair detections.
- Works with vanilla and most modded environments. If another plugin changes how NPC/admin flags are reported, adjust filters accordingly.

---

## Performance

- A single scan loops over `BasePlayer.activePlayerList`.
- With default cooldowns and typical populations, overhead is negligible.
- If you run very short cooldowns on high-pop servers, consider raising the cooldown or tightening filters.

---

## Changelog

- Cleanup on `Unload()` and minor polish for uMod submission guidelines.

- Public command-only release. Filters, per-player cooldown, permission tiers.
- Admin logs and `/scan.for` test command.
